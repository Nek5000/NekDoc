General Info

**How can I properly reference Nek5000?**

   If you use our software, please cite the following:

::

  NEK5000 Version X.Y. Release date. Argonne National Laboratory, Illinois. 
  Available: https://nek5000.mcs.anl.gov.

**What is the license for Nek5000?**

   Nek5000 is licensed under BSD.  
   For more information see the ``LICENSE`` file included with the distribution in the root level directory.

**Where can I find support or ask questions about Nek5000?**

   For any questions not answered in this document, you can email the Nek5000 community at large via the `mailing list <https://lists.mcs.anl.gov/mailman/listinfo/nek5000-users>`_.

----------------------------------
Installing, Compiling, and Running
----------------------------------

**Which platforms are supported by Nek5000?**

   All posix compliant operations system. 
   Compiling and running on Microsoft Windows 10 has been demonstrated using CMake and MinGW, although this is **not** supported.

**Which compilers work?**

   Currently GNU, Intel, PGI and IBM compilers are supported.

**When trying to recompile after increasing the number of elements I get the error below. Why does this happen and how can I avoid it?**

   ``relocation truncated to fit: R_X86_64 against symbol 'foo_' defined in COMMON section in obj/bar.o``

   This happens when the resultant executable requires more memory allocation than available, usually because ``lelt`` is too large.  
   The best way to avoid this is to increase the minimum number of MPI ranks, ``lpmin`` in ``SIZE``.  
   Alternatively, you can add ``-mcmodel=medium`` to the ``FFLAGS`` variable in ``makenek``.

**How do I launch a parallel run?**
  
  Assuming your machine has MPI configured correctly and you have pointed your ``makenek`` file to the correct compilers, parallel runs can be launced with the included ``nekmpi`` and ``nekbmpi`` scripts. 
  If you are running on a cluster, consult your sysadmin to write an appropriate submission script.

.. **My simulation diverges.  What should I do?**
  accept that we can't always get what we want...

**How do I run the examples?**

  The examples are included by default in the release tarball and the entire suite can be run with the NekTests.py script.  
  Each example should contain the appropriate files to be run manually as well.

-------------------
Computational Speed
-------------------

**How many elements should I have per processor?**

  This is highly dependent on the computer architecture you are using and ranges anywhere from a couple 100 in a workstation environment down to under 10 on a Blue Gene.
  This will also depend on the polynomial order, with a higher order running more efficiently on more cores.
  If possible, we recommend running a short scaling test by recording the amount of time required to run a set numer of time steps for various MPI ranks to find your particular strong-scaling limit.

.. **What is "projection" and should I use it?**
  magic, and yes, yes you should!

---------------------------
Problem Setup
---------------------------

**Why is it important to non-dimensionalize my case?**

  Nek5000 can be run with dimensions, but the solver tolerances assume the case has been non-dimensionalized properly.
  Additionally, cases which have been non-dimensionalized tend to be more stable and run faster.

**How do I choose solver tolerances?**

  Depends on how accurate you need your simulation to be.  
  Typical values are :math:`10^{-6}` for velocity and scalars and :math:`10^{-5}` for pressure.
  Note that solver tolerances do not represent the accuracy of the solution, but rather the accuracy in the update per time step, so these errors will accumulate for long running simulations. 

**What is the difference between Pn/Pn and Pn/Pn-2?**

   In brief, in the Pn/Pn formulation the pressure equation is solved on the same mesh as the velocity equations (:math:`P_n`), whereas in Pn/Pn-2 it is solved on a GLL mesh of lower order (:math:`P_{n-2}`). 
   Typically Pn/Pn-2 is more stable and slightly faster, but will yield a discontinuous pressure solution while Pn/Pn is able to better predict the wall shear.

**What polynomial order should I use?**

   This depends what you are after. The sweet spot is typically :math:`N=7` (lx1=8)

**How do I specify/change the polynomial order?**

   Change ``lx1`` in the SIZE file.

**How do I specify/change the solver runtime parameters?**

   See the section on the :ref:`case_files_par` file.

**Why is ``userbc`` only called for certain element faces?**

   ``userbc`` is ONLY called for element boundary conditions specified with a lower-case letter, e.g. 'v', 't', or 'o' but NOT 'W', 'E', or 'O'.  Note that this implies it is not necesarily called on all MPI ranks.


---------------------------
Physical Models
---------------------------

**How do I solve for a scalar?**

   Nek5000 supports solving up to 99 additional scalars.  
   To solve an additional scalar equation, increase ``ldimt`` in the ``SIZE`` file to accomodate the additional scalar and specify the appropriate parameter in the :ref:`case_files_par` file.  

**What turbulence models are available in Nek5000?**

   LES with explicit filtering (spectral damping) or high-pass filtering is available. 
   Other turbulence models are available through user file implementation including: dynamic Smagorinsky (turbChannel example), k-ω, k-ω SST, etc. (contact the developers for more information).

-------------------
Pre-Processing
-------------------

**How can I generate a mesh for use with Nek5000?**

   Please see the section on :ref:`mesh_gen`.

**What element types are supported?**

   Conformal curved quadrilateral/hexahedral elements.

**How do I convert a mesh to Nek5000?**

   We currently support conversion from the exodus file format with the ``exo2nek`` utility.

---------------
Post-Processing
---------------

**The local coordinate axes of my elements are not aligned with the global coordinate system, is this normal?**

   Yes, there is no guarantee that the elements are generated with any particular orientation (except if you use genbox).

**Where are my solution files and how do I visualize them?**

   By default Nek5000 outputs solution files in the binary ``0.f%05d`` format.  These can be read by both VisIt and ParaView in conjunction with a meta-data file.  For more information see :ref:`qstart_vis`.

**I have calculated additional fields from my solution (e.g. vorticity), how do I visualize them?**

   Using the ``.par`` file, define an additional scalar and include ``solver = none``, for example:

.. code-block:: none

   [SCALAR01] #vorticity
   solver = none

..

   Then store the calculated field in ``t(1,1,1,1,iscal+1)`` where ``iscal`` is your passive scalar index (in this example 1).

**How do I obtain values of variables at a specific point?**

  The simplest way is through the use of history points. See the section on the :ref:`case_files_his` file.

**How do I compute an integral over a boundary patch?**

  The included subroutine ``surface_int`` can be called in a loop over the appropriate element faces.
  This subroutine is further described in the section on :ref:`append_subroutines`.
